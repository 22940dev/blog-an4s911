## Introduction {#intro}

So, well here it is once more, about the undecillionth[^1] time writing the introduction. So basically this is my first blog ever on any site[^2]. This website is gonna be used for my blogging and as my portfolio to display my projects for potential, existing clients or just another pedestrian walking across the web to take a peek. I am also trying a few basic markdown features like footnotes. Thats why there are some irrelevant footnotes[^3].

## The serious stuff

I will be mainly publishing blogs related to Python 3, Linux OS (mainly Ubuntu), and my journey. I will try to publish a new blog for each new thing I learned will try to make it easy for others to understand and how I tackled some problems I encountered. So look out for those. 

### Why Python and Ubuntu?

#### Python

Python because that is the first programming language I learned. I am not an advanced python developer, just trying to improve my skills every day. I will be posting Python for beginners as well as deep dive into python's syntax and logic. The former will have fewer posts as there are tons of resources for beginners which I will be plugging in from time to time.

As for the deep dive, I will pick a particular topic[^4] and I will do my research on it and try my best to make it easily understood. This is mainly for those who wants a deeper knowledge of the language rather than just learning the syntax just typing code.

#### Ubuntu

Because that is what I know and I use. The OS I use is Ubuntu for almost everything. I once was a Windows user and installed Ubuntu just to test it out and fell in love with Linux OS and its terminal. So I switched completely to Ubuntu and its my full time operating system. I do have a dual boot system with Windows on the other side and I do use it occasionally for testing and disk related configurations for dual booting.

And also because I have a few things to talk about **Ubuntu**

Doesn't make any sense I know but I am just typing the first words that comes on my mind. Like the word tomatoes. OK you can go back top -->
[^4]: Topic includes data-types, keywords, built-in functions, OOP concepts etc from Python.
